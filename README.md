# Bindu - a practical dictionary Chrome extension

Bindu is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you look up definitions and translations without breaking your reading flow. Select text, then choose how you want to look it up: a context menu, a quick translation, or an inline popup.

## What you can do

- Look up words in multiple dictionaries from a right-click menu.
- Translate selected text instantly with one click.
- See an inline definition popup next to the text you selected.
- Hear US pronunciation audio and click speaker icons to play it again.

Supported sources include Wiktionary, Merriam-Webster, Han Dian, American Heritage Dictionary, Etymonline, Longman, and Google Translate.

## Install

Install Bindu from the Chrome Web Store if it is available to you. If your organization distributes Bindu directly, follow their provided installation steps.

## How to use

### 1) Context menu lookup

1. Select any word or phrase on a page.
2. Right-click and choose **Bindu**.
3. Pick a dictionary source to open in a new tab.

### 2) Quick translation (toolbar icon)

1. Select text on a page.
2. Click the Bindu toolbar icon.
3. Google Translate opens in a new tab (default target language: zh-TW).

### 3) Inline definition popup

1. Select text on a page.
2. Hold **Alt + Cmd** (macOS) or **Alt + Ctrl** (Windows/Linux), then release the mouse.
3. A compact popup appears near your selection.

The popup shows phonetics, part of speech, and definitions. It fades out after a short time or when you move the mouse away.

## Options

Open the options page from **Chrome Extensions** > **Bindu** > **Extension options**.

You can:

- Turn auto-play pronunciation on or off.
- Choose the pronunciation source (US audio).
- Enable Chinese translation in the popup (Bing Dictionary).

## Tips

- For the inline popup, keep the Alt key pressed until you release the mouse.
- If no audio plays, click the speaker icon next to a phonetic line.
- Some words have multiple entries; scroll inside the popup to see more.

## Permissions (plain language)

Bindu needs a few permissions to work:

- **Context menu**: adds dictionary choices when you right-click selected text.
- **Storage**: saves your options (auto-play, audio source, translation toggle).
- **Audio playback**: enables reliable pronunciation playback.

## Support

If something does not work, try reloading the page and selecting the text again. You can also disable and re-enable the extension from Chrome Extensions.
